## Introduction

[ohmypwsh](https://github.com/madpang/ohmypwsh) is fundamentally a PowerShell profile, much like a `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
It is a collection of scripts and functions that I use in my daily work.
It is inspired by [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh).

## Usage

To add device-dependent configurations, 
1. Create your configuration file at `conf` directory, e.g. `device-00-pwsh-conf.ps1`.
2. Create a `device-info` file in the dedicated ohmypwsh config directory---for macOS, the full path is `~/.ohmypwsh.d/device-info`---to link the configuration file name to the device name.

The content of the `device-info` file may look like this (`+++ JSON` and `+++` are part of the content):
```
+++ JSON
{
	"Your-Device-Name": {
		ConfPath: "device-00-pwsh-conf.ps1"
	}
}
+++
```

## Advanced usage

To use the device-dependent `Mount-Workspace` function, one needs to create a JSON file to store the necessary parameters for the remote storage mount operation for their system.
The content may look like this (`+++ JSON` and `+++` are part of the content):
```
+++ JSON
{
	WkspID: {
		MountPoint: "~/Workspace",
		HostID: "MyServer",
		VolumeID: "WKSP",
		VolumeType: "smbfs",
		UserID: "foo"
		UserPSW: "hogehoge"
	}
}
+++
```

Then encrypt the JSON file with GPG, e.g.
``` command
gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient <your_address@email.com> ./workspace-info
```

Put the encrypted file in the dedicated ohmypwsh config directory---for macOS, the full path is `~/.ohmypwsh.d/workspace-info.asc`.

There you go, the `Mount-Workspace` function will automatically load the parameters from the encrypted JSON file, and mount the remote storage for you with `Mount-Workspace WkspID`.
