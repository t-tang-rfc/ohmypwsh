--- Ticket 1-1

@brief:
Add proper color scheme for the 3 major fields of terminal prompt---user name, machine name, and path.

@details:
Need to use a hashtable to hold each prompt color component in a separate field.
In the past, I have spent quite a lot of time on an utility `SwitchTheme` that switches not only the terminmal prompt, but also macOS system wide dark/light theme, with automatical trigger by sunrise/sunset.
This time, I plan to create a PowerShell function `Switch-Theme ['dark' | 'light']`.
Given those experience tweaking w/ system-wide theme altogether, I decide this function should go into the platform-dependent utility category, and I first implement it in `macos-pwsh-conf.ps1`.
